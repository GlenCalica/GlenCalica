Hi! I'm Glen Calica. I'm currently a computer programming student based in Toronto. I'm primarily interested in full-stack web development, but I've also dabbled a bit in web design.

These are the technologies that I've used before:
- **Front-end:** JavaScript, Vue.js
- **Back-end:** NodeJS
- **Database:** Oracle SQL, MongoDB
- **Design:** Adobe XD
- **Tools:** Wordpress
- **Other languages:** C++, Java

I've previously been an administrative assistant in two different IT departments over four years at my previous university. When I was a student, I've spent several years as an officer at our international student organization (event coordinator and vice president).
